# Bull

Bull is an ecosystem of packages bundled together to form good foundations for high-level API wrappers.

Bull is not made to replace traditional Discord API wrappers, rather be a better foundation for them.

Bull is supposed to be a 100% MyPy type-safe low-level ecosystem of python-based tooling around the Discord API.
